# ARIMA-LinearRegression-prediction
<h2>Prediction based on historical data</h2>

In this application (scenario) we tend to predict the new patients for a practice for the next months. You can predict for more than a month ahead as well.

In this application we assume we dont know which model is the best!
so we choose between either of the ARIMA (time series) and linear regression.
after comparing the R squer values, we wouold decide which method to choose.
